PyWPS has been initialy started by
`Jachym Cepicky <http://les-ejk.cz>`_ as his project ,,Connecting
of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer`` supported by German 
`Foundation for Environment <http://dbu.de>`_. He began to work on
this project from April 2006 to September 2006, while he was on his
sholarship by `GDF-Hannover <http://gdf-hannover.de>`_ company. 

First site, which has adopted PyWPS as demo application was 
`WPS Demo <http://www.bnhelp.cz/mapserv/wpsdemo/index.php>` provided
by `Help Service Remote Sensing <http://www.bnhelp.cz>`_ company.

First presentation about PyWPS was held at 
`FOSS4G 2006 <http://foss4g2006.org>`_ conference in Lausanne. It's
name was `GRASS goes to web: PyWPS <http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=67&sessionId=48&confId=1>`_.

Around October 2006, the project homepage has been moved from Jachym's
personal homepage to GForge server hosted on 
http://wald.intevation.org, which is
maintained by `Intevation GmbH <http://intevation.org>`_ company
to support their projects. Since this date, PyWPS has it's own mailing
lists, subversion repository and other necessary infrastructure for Open
Source project.

In October 2006, other developers joined the development, so that it is
possible to speak about `PyWPS Development Team <contributors>`_.
