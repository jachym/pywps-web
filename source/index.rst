Welcome to PyWPS
################

(Python Web Processing Service) is an implementation of the `Web processing
Service <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps>`_ standard from `Open
Geospatial Consortium <http://opengeospatial.org>`_.

It has been started in Mai 2006 as a project supported by
`DBU <http://dbu.de>`_ and is currently (2009) mainly sponsored by
`HS-RS <http://www.bnhelp.cz>`_. It offers an environment for programming own
processes (geofunctions or models) which can be accessed from the public. The
main advantage of PyWPS is, that it has been written with native support
for `GRASS GIS <http://grass.itc.it>`_. Access to GRASS modules via web
interface should be as easy as possible.

PyWPS is written in `Python <http://python.org>`_, your processes must use this language too.

2010-01-22 PyWPS Recomended as THE WPS tool in GIGAS project
------------------------------------------------------------
    PyWPS was recomended as WPS tool in the `GIGAS <http://www.thegigasforum.eu/>`_ project.

        PyWPS Web Processing Service: is a Python program which implements the
        OGC WPS 1.0.0 standard (with a few omissions). PyWPS was chosen as it
        is up to date with the WPS standard and has a low footprint, making it
        easy to install on most Linux systems.  Python was considered a good
        choice of implementation language as it is a very easy language to
        develop in and allows partners to easily integrate existing processing
        which may have been written in other languages. PyWPS documentation may
        be found at http://pywps.wald.intevation.org/documentation/index.html

    See  http://www.thegigasforum.eu/cgi-bin/download.pl?f=342.pdf

2008-10-01 PyWPS 2.0.1
----------------------

    Today, PyWPS 2.0.1 was released. It is a bugfix release, which fixes the "PyWPSdebug" issue reported by several people.

    Have fun!

2008-10-01 PyWPS 2.0.0
----------------------

    http://pywps.wald.intevation.org

    After a year of development, Python Web Processing Service (PyWPS) 2.0.0 is available with a new stable release, which fixes a lot of bugs and instabilities from the  previous 1.0.0 version, as well as add a lot of new functionality.

    PyWPS implements OGC Web Processing Service 0.4.0 standard [1]. It is developed with native support for GRASS GIS [2], however, it can be used with other GIS command line tools too (PROJ, GDAL/OGR, ...), as well as with the R Project for Statistical Computing.

    OGC Web Processing Service specification provides client access across a network to pre-programmed calculations and/or computation models that operate on spatially referenced data. The calculation can be extremely simple or highly complex, with any number of data inputs and outputs. It does not specify the specific processes that could be implemented by a WPS. Instead, it specifies a generic mechanism that can be used to describe and web-enable any sort of geospatial process.

    Several client applications can be used with PyWPS, e.g. Embrio project [3] and there is also plugin for OpenLayers [4][5].

    Major changes:

    * New Process interface for easier coding
    * More stable, temporary files should be deleted in any case
    * More verbose, better debugging output
    * OGC WPS 0.4.0 still not yet fully implemented, but close to
    * ...

    New development should be focused at implementation of the OGC WPS 1.0.0 specification.
